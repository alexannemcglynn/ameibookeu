I'm really on a nostalgia kick, and I've bought a couple copies of old NFS titles. Carbon and Most Wanted. I played them a lot as a kid, including Hot Pursuit 2, and I'm not sure if it's just my nostalgia for the older games talking, but I feel like none of the reboots ever got the same amount of exposure/attention that the originals had, and it seems like it would be a waste if my time to play them.

Same as the title, here it goes. Since Yorpie’s mod for the bait crates was just made not that long ago, I thought I’d address this before the release of 2019. I remember during the release of Payback, when people found out there was no free roaming police cars in the game like it was in the older games (including 2015 for that matter) it pretty much ruined the overall hype of the game when it was being released, and people most certainly weren’t happy with it.

Get ready for edge-of-your-seat, open-world pursuits in our most connected I know GOG managed to get a batch of older EA titles like Spore a while back even though those titles are actually available to buy on Origin. I'm curious as to why older titles that aren't available anywhere anymore never made it to GOG, they seem like a no brainer. I know that some of the later NFS games starting with Hot Pursuit 2 are difficult to re-release due to them featuring a licensed soundtrack, but all games released before that feature an original score, I've asked the composers.

Most people talk about the cars and such of NFS, but not many discuss the city which is a shame because the city is the second most important part of a NFS game. Today I wanna talk about basically landmarks of the city. Those things that you want to just stop and take pictures of with your car. I think stuff like what I'm about to show can make cities in NFS feel more lively. Now yes I'm aware MW12 had tons of sculptures and stuff like that. But the last 2 NFS games just lacked Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 - это одна из лучших частей серии игр Need for Speed.

About This Game Need for Speed Hot Pursuit launches you into a new open-world landscape behind the wheel of the world's fastest and most beautiful. Most arcade racing games franchises eventually ended up with open world setting - NFS did so in Underground 2, but there were also Test Drive Unlimited, Forza Horizon, Burnout Paradise. And while open world has its pros and cons, I'd wonder if closed courses are still relevant. Of course, the lack of open world in early games was a technical limitation, but the lack of roads to drive didn't limit the gameplay. On the contrary, the courses had their own distinct feel to them, both in terms.

A few friends and I are looking for a racing game (arcade rather than sim) to play with 8 player via lan, and since EA stores is currently on sale, that seemed fitting. It's not a pure "offline" lan party, so if the requirement to connect online, that's not an issue. I haven't played NFS games in ages, so I have no idea what's good. From what I read so far, Hot Pursuit (2010?) and Pro Street seem the way to go, though Pro Street is not in the store? If anyone could me out, I'd appreciate.

Spikes, stun mines, turbos, jamners, emps, esf, shock ram, shock wave. Any and all pursuit tech from rivals and hp2010. Heli for cops would drop spikes and heli for racer would drop nitro(?) Stun mines(?) And road block would be hired goons. 2) Scale cops. This one is a pipedream. Different settings. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 представляет собой аркадную гоночную игру, выполненную в трёхмерной графике. To be clear: I have been playing Destiny since D1. Therefore, I understand that the current weekly reward structure of the Raids has been fairly standard for a long time. That being said, as someone who enjoys raiding (and NF's/other endgame activities) because of the thrill involved in the requisite skill and teamwork, I would enjoy it if there was some incentive to replay Raids on the same character each week. Now, I am likely in the minority here. I often run the raids a second or third. В Need for Speed Hot Pursuit игроки смогут ощутить восторг погони в режимах карьеры при игре как за гонщиков, так и за полицейских - в одиночку или в Интернете. Все. I was playing NFS: Carbon online for the first time with someone and we couldn’t figure out how to send an invite to a friend. When you load up a custom match it tells you that it put you in a ore-game lobby and you can send private invites to friends, however we could not find this option. The only way we got it to work is by pressing start at the same time to find players. And since no one plays online anymore it was able to pair us up.

I've played a lot of the games, but only really loved NFSIII:Hot Pursuit of the classic NFS games and basically played that for my racing kick till the remake came out in 2010. That is my go-to now. I love the open-ish world, I love the career mode instead of a story, etc. Basically everything about it is exactly what I look for in a racing game. Is there a spiritual successor to Hot Pursuit?

Wanted to get the subs thoughts on the game and its mechanics (handling, customization, cop chases), which I know this sub likes to talk a lot about regarding NFS 2015 and Payback. Personally: I loved how the vehicles handled in that game compared to NFS 2015 and Payback. Cars like the BMW M3 GTR and the Koenigsegg Agera R were a blast to drive, and I felt like I had complete control of the vehicle when turning and drifting, especially compared to NFS 2015. In 2015, I felt like there Hot Pursuit goes back to the Need for Speed series' roots and takes on the gameplay style of earlier Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit and Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 titles in the Need for Speed franchise with exotic cars and high-speed police chases.

Even if a mode appeared in more than one game (e.g. Drag or Drift events), was there potentially something that made you prefer one iteration of that mode over another? Stuff like how you score points, and so on.

WARNING: This is my opinion, definitely let me know what you think down in the comments. It hit me like a ton of bricks today. All those NFS that are extremely liked by the community, Underground, Most Wanted, etc, lack one thing, drifting. While this isn't all true for every NFS game, like Hot Pursuit 2010 has drifting, drifting ruined the series because its all looks, and lacks precision. I know there are plenty of other factors that hurt NFS, but drifting is something I noticed that great.
